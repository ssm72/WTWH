			<p id="aboutpara" align="center">Henna is a commonly used plant product that can be ground into a paste and used as a a temporary tattoo or paint product. Henna is common in many different cultures and makes for an attractive, dark and semi-permanent tattoo. However, there are a number of benefits that henna can provide to you that aren't related to the appearance of the tattoo or the design on your skin. The art of henna (called mehndi in Hindi & Urdu) has been polished for over 5000 years in Pakistan, India, Africa and the Middle East. There is some documentation that it is in excess of 9000 years of age.  Because henna has common cooling properties, individuals of the desert, for a long time, have been utilizing henna to chill off their bodies.</p>
